# smash
A super minimalist shell written in many languages.
Just to **have fun** and **learn** new languages !

## âœ¨ features

**smash** must be able to do :
- commands                (eg: `wc -l`)
- chaining                (eg: `ls && wc -l || ls`)
- piping                  (eg: `ls | wc -l`)
- change directories      (eg: `cd $path`, `cd -`, `cd ~` should work)
- exit gracefully
